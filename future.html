            <div class="opening">
            <p>Despite its sunny persona, tiki's history is far from welcoming and inclusive. First and foremost, tiki's U.S. representation conflates several Polynesian, Southeast Asian, and even Caribbean cultures - often sufferers at the hands of American Colonialism - into its singular vision. As a result, there is a misrepresentation, lack of credit, or historical impact acknowledgment of these unique audiences.

                Tiki kitsch reinforce stereotypes and emphasize exoticism. Modern tiki often rebrands as a broader "tropical" theme, recognizing this fraught history. Simply replacing tiki mask mugs with palm leaf designs is not a cure-all, though.

                A new generation of bar owners and spirits specialists brings new life,  diversity, and understanding to this treasured genre. </p>

                <p class="tanam_text">Bars like Boston's Tanám represent the evolution of modern tiki. Bar owners Kyisha Davenport, Sāsha Coleman, and Ellie Tiglao are reinvigorating tiki by "infusing their tiki drinks with deeper meaning and stories," an evolution they call Afro-Tiki. Through food, drink, and conversation, their vision centers on Black and Brown voices to shed light on these marginalized and often forgotten contributions to tiki.</p>

                <p class="tatsu_text">Headed southwest to Austin, Texas, Tiki Tatsu-Ya incorporates Japanese culture into its modern vision and moves away from its classic tropes to focus on tropical rather than tiki branding. The bar's narrative focuses on a fictional island and draws inspiration from various sources, and chooses to be more nondescript in its style. Patrons can expect a surreal experience.</p>
